## What data is collected?

The extension does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal information from users.

- Email content is processed only temporarily in your browser.
- When using the AI feature, the email content is sent to a remote AI service (OpenAI/Groq) for task extraction. This data is not stored or reused.

## Permissions

These permissions are strictly required for the extension to fulfill its core purpose.

## Third-party services

This extension may communicate with external services like OpenAI or Groq for processing email content and generating task suggestions. These services do not store or reuse the content submitted.
